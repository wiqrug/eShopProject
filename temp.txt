Candidate Model is done and is functional.

Need to create Admin,Marker,qc.

Read about entity framework and Table-Per-Hierarchy (TPH)

Update the dbs, they should have createdAt column

Note for Konstantinos so that even if I forget I'll have you to scold me: 
Also test each API so that it works according to the right authFilter.
Then add an API so that a candidate can see their personal info.
